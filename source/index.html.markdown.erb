## What's this?

**StenoBricks** is a project by [Drew Neil][] that aims to visualize how Plover Steno theory works.
If you're interested in learning more about Plover, the best place to start is by reading [Learn Plover][] by Zack Brown.
The rest of this article assumes that you are familiar with Plover Steno theory.

**StenoBricks** is currently a proof of concept and the site may be considered *in beta* status.
That means that things may move around and URLs may change.
You have been warned.

You can find the [source code for StenoBricks on github][source].
