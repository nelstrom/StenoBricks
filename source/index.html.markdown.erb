## What's this?

**StenoBricks** is a project by [Drew Neil][] that aims to visualize how Plover Steno theory works.
If you're interested in learning more about Plover, the best place to start is by reading [Learn Plover][] by Zack Brown.
The rest of this article assumes that you are familiar with Plover Steno theory.

**StenoBricks** is currently a proof of concept and the site may be considered *in beta* status.
That means that things may move around and URLs may change.
You have been warned.

You can find the [source code for StenoBricks on github][source].

### What's a Steno Brick?

A Steno Brick is one or more keystrokes that stand for a sound.
For example, `K` is a brick that stands for the 'K' sound.
`W` is a brick that stands for the 'W' sound.
Together, `KW` forms a brick that stands for the 'QU' sound.

Some keystrokes on the steno keyboard can produce more than one brick.
For example, `-F` may produce the 'F' sound, the 'V' sound, or the 'S' sound, meaning that 3 separate bricks all correspond to the same keystroke.
Similarly, `-FRPB` may produce the 'NCH' sound or the 'RCH' sound, so that cluster of keystrokes can produce two different bricks.

You can [browse our collection of bricks][bricks]. For each brick, we illustrate how it looks on a StenoBrick diagram and list some example definitions that use the brick.
